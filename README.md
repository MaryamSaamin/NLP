# language_tools_project

👋 Hey NLP lovers! 

🚀 Core Features

1. Multi-language support: allow choosing arbitrary source/target languages (not just English→Farsi).

2. Language selection UI: replace the hard-coded “Translate to Farsi” button with a dropdown of languages.

3. Additional NLP tools: add “Paraphrase”, “Sentiment Analysis” and “Keyword Extraction” alongside translate & summarize.

4. Model selection: let users pick between different transformer back-ends (e.g. MarianMT, Helsinki, T5, Pegasus).

5. Batch processing: support translating/summarizing multiple inputs at once.

📱 UI/UX Enhancements

6. Loading indicators: show spinners or progress bars during long model inferences.

7. Mobile responsiveness: optimize layout and touch-targets for phones/tablets.

8. Dark mode & theming: add a toggle and persist users’ theme preferences.

9. Input history & clear all: keep a session history of past translations/summaries.

📂 File I/O

10. File upload support: accept .txt and PDF uploads for translation/summarization.

11. Export results: enable downloading output as .txt, .docx or PDF.

🔧 Backend & Ops

12. Model caching: load each model once at startup instead of per-request.

13. Result caching: memoize translations/summaries to speed up repeat queries.

14. Rate limiting: prevent abuse by throttling requests per IP/user.

15. Robust error handling: catch and nicely display model/timeout errors.

16. Logging & monitoring: integrate structured logs and basic health checks.

🔍 Testing & CI

17. Unit tests: cover translator.py and summarizer.py logic.

18. E2E/UI tests: use a headless browser to test the full flow.

19. CI pipeline: add GitHub Actions for linting, tests, and builds on every PR.

20. Static analysis: integrate Black/Flake8 for Python and ESLint/Prettier for JS/CSS.

21. Test coverage: publish coverage reports and enforce a minimum threshold.

📝 Docs & Community

22. Getting Started guide: write clear setup steps (install, env vars, run).

23. CONTRIBUTING.md: outline how to file issues, code style, branch workflow.

24. Issue/PR templates: add boilerplate templates to standardize contributions.

25. Code of Conduct: foster a welcoming community with a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

26. Roadmap: sketch upcoming releases/features to align contributors.

🚢 Packaging & Deployment

27. Docker support: add a Dockerfile + docker-compose.yml for easy local/dev testing.

28. Cloud deployment: scripts or GitHub Action to deploy to Heroku/AWS/GCP.

29. Versioning & releases: tag and publish GitHub Releases with changelogs.

30. Dependabot: enable automated dependency update PRs.
